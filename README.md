# Introduction
I created this project when I was planning my hiking trip to Nikko, Japan during Late May, 2025. Yamap is a popular hiking app in Japan, but it's a hassle to get gpx file from it. (i.e., it requires users to sign up and pay for a subscription to download the gpx file, which is reasonable and I fully understand.)

# Disclaimer
USE WITH CAUTION. 
<br/><i>Honetly, I feel unethical to use this project to scrape data from Yamap.</i>

# Project Goal

The goal of this project is to convert the activity data to a GPX file so that I can use it in other apps like Gaia GPS.

# Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
